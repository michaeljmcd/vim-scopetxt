There is a really, really good chance that this isn't your thing.

But, if you're still here, this is a syntax highlighting file for my text-based
method of putting together project scopes for work. Some fictional examples are
in the `examples/` directory to give you a feel for it. The general idea is to
type up scopes in plain text with some annotations and call outs and have them
display reasonably in Vim.
